                <p class="problem-description">
                    Urban traffic congestion, particularly at signalized
                    intersections, causes massive economic losses, environmental
                    damage, and reduced quality of life. Current traffic management
                    systems operate on fixed timers or simple vehicle detection,
                    failing to adapt to real-time traffic fluctuations and lacking
                    predictive capabilities.

                <p class="solution-description">
                    We propose an integrated system that combines IoT sensing with
                    AI-driven optimization. Four ultrasonic sensors at each intersection
                    monitor traffic queues in real-time. This data feeds into two
                    complementary machine learning models: a Reinforcement Learning system
                    that dynamically adjusts traffic signals, and a Predictive Analytics
                    model that forecasts traffic patterns for route recommendations. Results
                    are delivered through a userfriendly web application that advises drivers
                    on optimal travel times and routes.
